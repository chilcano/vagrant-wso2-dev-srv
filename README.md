# Vagrant WSO2 Development Server Box

> This Vagrant box was the older [box-vagrant-wso2-dev-srv](https://holisticsecurity.wordpress.com/2015/11/11/creating-a-vm-with-wso2-servers-for-development).
> I have removed the rTail Puppet modules to create a new rTail server Docker Container.
> The older GitHub repository for [box-vagrant-wso2-dev-srv](https://holisticsecurity.wordpress.com/2015/11/11/creating-a-vm-with-wso2-servers-for-development) will not be updated.
> I recommend you using this new one, more lightweight and flexible.


This VM is suitable to develop with WSO2 products and puts focus only in the `server side` (WSO2 servers, mock server and different tools to host our micro/services) and not in `desktop side` (Eclipse, SoapUI, Maven, etc.).
The main objetive is to have a VM with all WSO2 products installed and configured to be ready for development and following the most common Middleware infrastructure pattern used to create (Micro)services.
The `naming` used in `hostnames` tries to use pre-defined values what also will be used in Integration and Production Environments. The `ports` and `offsets` used do not follow any special rule.

This VM tries to implement 2 tiers for the middleware and they are:

**Front tier**
- In the first tier are mainly are located a first instance of WSO2 ESB.
- The purpose of this instance of WSO2 ESB is to implement all type of `validations` as JSON Schema, XSD Schema, etc.
- WSO2 Governance Registry and WSO2 Data Service Server also have been placed in this tier.

**Back tier**
- The second tier where mainly is placed a second instance of WSO2 ESB. 
- The purpose of this instance is to implement all type of `transformations` as from XML to JSON, from JSON to XML, etc.
- Altough WSO2 AM has different deployment patterns and WSO2 AM (Gateway) should be in the front tier, I have placed WSO2 AM (Gateway, Publisher, Store and Key Manager) in this tier.

**The Backend**
- I wanna use Wiremock as mock server to implement REST and SOAP services.


If you have the jar and zip files previously downloaded, just place your files under `%VM_VAGRANT_HOME%/_downloads/`

My directory structure looks like:

### Details about the installed servers

- The servers are installed under the `/opt/` folder.
- The init.d scripts were copied under `/etc/inid.d/` folder.
- The WSO2 Administrator username and password are `admin/admin`.


## 2. Getting started

__1) Download the Vagrant scripts__

```
$ git clone https://github.com/chilcano/vagrant-wso2-dev-srv.git
$ cd ~/github-repo/vagrant-wso2-dev-srv
```

__2) Start the Vagrant box__

The first time this process will take long time becuase the ISO Linux image and the WSO2 and required software have to be downloaded, unzipped, installed and provisioning the scripts.

```
$ vagrant up
```

__3) Stop, reload and re/provisioning__


To stop the Vagrant box.
```bash
$ vagrant halt
```


If you have modified the Puppet modules or Shell scrips, then you have to start with the flag `provision` and `reload` enabled, or both enabled, to re-provisioning to Vagrant.
```bash
$ vagrant reload
$ vagrant provision
```

Or reload and re-provision.
```bash
$ vagrant reload --provision
```

__4) Get SSH access to the Vagrant box__

```
$ vagrant ssh
```

__5) Get SSH access to the Vagrant box__

If for any reason you want left at a clean state (as if you never created the guest machine in the first place) or remove clompletly your Vagrant, then to use the follow:


```bash
# Stops the running Vagrant machine and destroy all created resources 
# that were created during the machine creation process
$ vagrant destroy


# Remove completly the Vagrant machine
$ cd vagrant-wso2-dev-srv
$ vagrant box remove <NAME>

# or
$ vagrant box list
kube-fedora21          (virtualbox, 0)
puphpet/ubuntu1404-x64 (virtualbox, 2.0)
ubuntu/trusty32        (virtualbox, 0)

# Where <NAME> is, i.e. 'puphpet/ubuntu1404-x64'
$ vagrant box remove <NAME>
```

__6) Vagrant Global Status__

If you want to know the state of all active Vagrant environments on the system for the currently logged in user, to use the follow:

```bash
Chilcano@Pisc0 : ~/1github-repo/vagrant-wso2-dev-srv
$ vagrant global-status
id       name       provider   state    directory
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
02b5d3f  master     virtualbox poweroff /Users/Chilcano/1github-repo/shuttlecloud-docker-k8-workshop-20160116/kubernetes
f4699ed  minion-1   virtualbox poweroff /Users/Chilcano/1github-repo/shuttlecloud-docker-k8-workshop-20160116/kubernetes
2c03b60  wso2devsrv virtualbox running  /Users/Chilcano/1github-repo/vagrant-wso2-dev-srv

The above shows information about all known Vagrant environments
on this machine. This data is cached and may not be completely
up-to-date. To interact with any of the machines, you can go to
that directory and run Vagrant, or you can use the ID directly
with Vagrant commands from any directory. For example:
"vagrant destroy 1a2b3c4d"
```


## 3. Starting the WSO2 servers and Wiremock


__1) Starting the WSO2 servers__

When starting the first time any WSO2 server, you have to start it by running with this command `wso2server.sh -Dsetup` and using the user `vagrant`.
With the `-Dsetup` flag, WSO2 will initialize the local/internal Database and will populate with a few data.

```bash
$ ./opt/%WSO2_SERVER_NAME%/bin/wso2server.sh -Dsetup
...
[2015-11-11 07:21:20,886]  INFO - RegistryEventingServiceComponent Successfully Initialized Eventing on Registry
[2015-11-11 07:21:21,361]  INFO - JMXServerManager JMX Service URL  : service:jmx:rmi://localhost:11117/jndi/rmi://localhost:10005/jmxrmi
[2015-11-11 07:21:21,361]  INFO - StartupFinalizerServiceComponent Server           :  WSO2 Enterprise Service Bus-4.8.1
[2015-11-11 07:21:21,362]  INFO - StartupFinalizerServiceComponent WSO2 Carbon started in 24 sec
[2015-11-11 07:21:21,701]  INFO - CarbonUIServiceComponent Mgt Console URL  : https://192.168.11.20:9449/carbon/
```

Repeat this process for each WSO2 instance by replacing `%WSO2_SERVER_NAME%` for `wso2am02a`, `wso2esb01a`, `wso2esb02a`, `wso2dss01a` and `wso2greg01a`.

To close the running server, just `CTRL+C` in the shell console where the server is running, this will release the shell console.


__2) Starting WSO2 the next time__

The next times when starting the WSO2 servers, I recommend to use the `init.d` scripts already created instead of `wso2server.sh` directly.
Using these `init.d` scripts the WSO2 instances will start as a Linux service and will create `pid` and `lock` files.


```bash
$ sudo service %WSO2_SERVER_NAME% start|stop|restart|status
```

The `init.d` scripts available in `/etc/init.d/` match with the name of WSO2 and Wiremock instances and they are `wso2am02a`, `wso2esb01a`, `wso2esb02a`, `wso2dss01a`, `wso2greg01a` and `wiremock`.


## 4. Enabling linux services to start automatically

I have faced some troubles using `init.d` scripts in this Vagrant box (probably is because it is based on Ubuntu image) where I have lost the control of every server when starting, reloading and provisioning this Vagrant box, for this reason I recommend you do not enable the services to start automatically on boot up.

I have removed the Puppet scripts to enable this functionality, but if you want do it, below are the commands:
```bash
$ sudo update-rc.d %WSO2_SERVER_NAME% defaults
```
Or
```bash
$ sudo update-rc.d %WSO2_SERVER_NAME% enable
```

To disable it, just execute the next command:
```bash
$ sudo update-rc.d %WSO2_SERVER_NAME% disable
```

To remove completly, but after that make sure to restart the Vagrant image:
```bash
$ sudo update-rc.d %WSO2_SERVER_NAME% remove
```

To check what Linux services are running or enabled, just execute this in your VM:
```bash
$ service --status-all
 ...
 [ - ]  wiremock
 [ - ]  wso2am02a
 [ - ]  wso2dss01a
 [ - ]  wso2esb01a
 [ - ]  wso2esb02a
 [ - ]  wso2greg01a
 ...
```


## 5. Monitoring the (Micro)services: Logging

This Vagrant box can be used as source of log events to feed or send them to other Box.
I have used this Vagrant box to send log events of all WSO2 servers and Wiremock server to an ELK and rTail Server Docker container.
This Vagrant box is prepared to send logs to ELK by using Filebeat and/or to rTail Server by broadcasting the log events as UDP traffic.

Below, both strategies are explained.
For rTail:

For ELK:

## 6. Monitoring the Infrastructure

_Soon I will use one of them: Riemann, Jolokia, CollectD/Graphite, Grafana, etc...._


## 7. Deploying WSO2 C-App (car files) from Maven

_Soon I will post further details how to do that._


## 8. TODO

- Load balancing and Virtual Hosts/IPs (HA Proxy or nginx)
- Custom HealthCheck
- Correlation propagation between WSO2 servers and Backend 
- Custom Mediators (Authentication, Authorization, Logging, Correlation, Common Validations and Transformations)
- ~~WSO2 services patterns deployed as samples~~ (Check It here: https://github.com/chilcano/wso2-ei-patterns)
- ~~Docker~~ (Check It here: https://holisticsecurity.wordpress.com/2016/01/11/strategy-to-create-microservices-using-wso2-and-docker)

## 10. Troubleshooting

1.- `Error: Cannot allocate memory - fork(2)`

This is because there isn't space in the swap partition or there isn't swap partition.

```
$ vagrant ssh
$ free -m

             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
Mem:          4038       2551       1487          0         13        195
-/+ buffers/cache:       2342       1696
Swap:
```
Follow this instructions to solve it: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-on-ubuntu-12-04

2.- `Error: Syntax error at '.'; expected '}'`.

This is because Puppet hasn't enable the `future parser`. 

```
==> wso2srv: Error: Syntax error at '.'; expected '}' at /tmp/vagrant-puppet/modules-7649381c00c1b064b7b0aaf106eac610/wso2esb/manifests/copy_files.pp:12 on node wso2-dev-srv-01.local
```
To enable `future parser`in Puppet, just add this line `parser = future` to `/etc/puppet/puppet.conf`

```bash
Chilcano@Pisc0 : ~/1github-repo/vagrant-wso2-dev-srv
$ vagrant ssh

$ vagrant reload --provision
```

3.- Vagrant can't mouth folders (`Failed to mount folders in Linux guest. This is usually because ...`)

Has been reported a bug in VirtualBox Guest Additions 4.3.10 where is not possible mount folders. For this reason, Vagrant can not share folders between guest and host. 
Further details here: [https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12879](https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/12879)

I have created a guide for you to fix that: [_downloads/vagrant-vboxguestadditions-workaroud.md](_downloads/vagrant-vboxguestadditions-workaroud.md)
